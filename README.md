# Vi-Hate-Speech-Detection
## Introduction
- Hate speech is a serious problem in the online community. It can cause harm to individuals, groups, and society. Therefore, detecting hate speech is an important task in natural language processing. 
- In this project, we aim to build a hate speech detection system for Vietnamese social media comments. We will use machine learning and deep learning models to classify comments into toxic and non-toxic categories.
- The project is divided into the following parts:
    + Data explore
    + Preprocessing
    + Model
    + Evaluation
    + Deployment
